# 🏢 PPG Interiors – Interior Design Website

A modern, minimalist **freelance website project** developed for an **interior design company based in the UAE**.

🌐 **Live Website:** https://ppginteriors.com

The client’s core requirement was a **subtle, premium, corporate aesthetic** inspired by the iconic *“American Psycho business card”* feel — clean typography, restrained layouts, pastel tones, and a confident, high-end business presence. The design was intentionally crafted to stay as close as possible to this inspiration while maintaining clarity, usability, and a lightweight user experience.

## 🎯 Client Requirements & Design Vision

The client specifically requested a website that:

- Feels **minimal yet premium**
- Communicates a **calm, confident corporate identity**
- Uses **pastel and muted color palettes**
- Relies on **typography, spacing, and alignment** rather than decoration
- Avoids heavy visuals, noise, or aggressive animations
- Delivers a **fast, smooth, and lightweight browsing experience**

The objective was not visual excess, but to convey **professionalism, trust, and refinement** through subtle design choices.

## 🎨 Design Inspiration & Approach

The visual direction draws inspiration from **high-end corporate branding**, particularly the understated elegance of luxury business card design. The entire layout follows a restrained, intentional approach where every element has a purpose.

Core design principles applied throughout the project:

- Minimalism over ornamentation
- White space used as a structural element
- Soft contrast instead of bold or loud colors
- Smooth, non-intrusive transitions
- Strong emphasis on typography hierarchy
- Lightweight visuals to preserve performance and fluidity

Each section was designed to feel **balanced, composed, and purposeful**, aligning with a premium interior design brand identity.
